# Robotics FEE Line Follower Competition Competition 2021  
### This robot (Zaghlol) was designed and assembled with contribution of:
Asmaa Salim - Salma Bakr - Mohamed Elfar - Ahmed Ashraf - Omar Elsobkey

### Robot Parts:
* 3 IR Sensors were made using TCRT5000 with LM358 OP-AMP for analog to digital output conversion. These sensors are for line detecting.
* Motor Driver Circuit using L293D to control both the speed and direction of the motors.
* Power ditribution circuit that outputs 12, 5 VDC to power the arduino, the motors and the sensors with three LM7805 connected in parallel in order to have high output ampere.
* Arduino Uno R3 to control the whole functionality of the robot

### Used Softwares:
* Arduino IDE for Arduino Code
* Altium and EAGLE for PCB Design
* Fusion360 for EAGLE's PCB 3D modeling
* Proteus For Simulation

### This repo includes:
* PCB files
* Arduino Code
* Robot presentation
* 3D modeling of the assembled robot
